WUPDASHARRUUFDSHDAFD! I love their wings and am just disappointed. When you are in Buffalo, go to Duff&amp;#39;s. Their wings are indeed the best. I&amp;#39;m going there tomorrow, then!</p>

                <p class= "text">Been here a couple times, the food and more specifically wings are very good! Wings, although could have had more meat on them, were very good. They had a great crunchy breading on them with a fair amount of sauce. Only complaint about this location is the size and service. This location has pretty much NEVER been updated, atmosphere is non existent. Also the building is small so there is always a wait and not many waitresses. Too conclude: Great food, but bad location. I would either suggest going to a diffrent duffs that is bigger (like the New eastern hills mall location) or going to a place with amazing atmosphere, like buffalo wild wings ( a favorite of mine). Hope this helps!</p>

                <p class= "text">As a former volunteer docent and chaperone of the Martin House, I was surprised by many of the comments listed below! These past reviewers do make a good point to call ahead to see what will be included in the tour since the house is under extensive renovation and points on the tour do change. The Martin House does offer multiple tours, so you may want to weigh your options in advance. Believe me, this house is amazing and worth any time you have to go see it will be time well spent!</p>

                <p class= "text">This tour is wonderful!!! We visited the Martin house complex on Oct. 26, 2011 and it was amazing. We took the two hour &amp;quot;In Depth&amp;quot; tour and were really glad we did. We felt we definitely got our money&amp;#39;s worth and were happily tired by the tour&amp;#39;s end. The guide was extremely knowledgeable and friendly - as were the hostesses in the visitor&amp;#39;s center. The movie that begins the tour was very informative. The restoration work is at a great point in its development. We saw so many inside rooms - all we cared to see, really. (The In Depth tour takes you inside all of the buildings.) For anyone who is a fan of FLW this tour is a must!</p>

                <p class= "text">This house is a treasure. For anyone who appreciates architecture, this Frank Lloyd Wright home, that was built for Darwin Martin is significant. After years of neglect this home is being restored with tender loving care. It is worth visiting often to see the progress. I just joined so that I can visit when I&amp;#39;d like and shop for gifts at a discount in the lovely gift shop.</p>

                <p class= "text">A great location, but not business oriented. I arrived on Friday at 1:00 PM and they were unable to press my suit for the entire weekend. My room had not been prepared without feathers as requested four weeks in advance. The shower had part of an old band-aid in the tub. No refrigerator or mini-bar in the room or hookup for an iPod. When I went to have breakfast I was seated in a section with food on the floor and I had to wipe milk off my menu. The elevators take longer to arrive than in any hotel I have ever stayed in. The plus was that one of the Asst. Managers saw what happened, acknowledged the problems, and went out of her way to make it up to me. I had a package arrive after I had left, and she forwarded it immediately and comped me for breakfast. This is why I gave it two stars instead of one. If they had a general manager like her, they might attract business people.</p>

                <p class= "text">I give this Hyatt a below average rating because for the price and class, this hotel should be providing more amenities. - No WiFi in the rooms, only in the lobby/atrium area (as if I enjoy doing business work in the lobby). - The business center only has one PC with no printers hooked up (print queue had 38 prints waiting and the manager simply said the PC is more for airline crews to quickly check on their flights, if they had a different business center she didn&amp;#39;t offer it up). - My room was well decorated and very comfortable, befitting of a Hyatt, but no coffee maker, no fridge, no microwave (I did have a kitchen style sink, it was a suite after all). The LCD TV was nice, though I hate the slow remote and no channel guide/info, as if I&amp;#39;m supposed to know what&amp;#39;s playing in Buffalo. - It is in downtown with a short walk to the convention center, and I highly recommend the Anchor Bar, Gordon&amp;#39;s Pub, and the Pearl St Brewery for local fair. - Oh yes, friendly staff, as always!</p>
