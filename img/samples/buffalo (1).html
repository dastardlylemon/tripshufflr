                <p class="text">I recently went to the Hyatt for a catered business lunch and I can honestly say that it was the best and truly healthiest business lunch that I&amp;#39;ve ever had. I sincerely appreciate the Hyatt&amp;#39;s effort to deliver healthy and delicious food.</p>

                <p class="text">A great location, but not business oriented. I arrived on Friday at 1:00 PM and they were unable to press my suit for the entire weekend. My room had not been prepared without feathers as requested four weeks in advance. The shower had part of an old band-aid in the tub. No refrigerator or mini-bar in the room or hookup for an iPod. When I went to have breakfast I was seated in a section with food on the floor and I had to wipe milk off my menu. The elevators take longer to arrive than in any hotel I have ever stayed in. The plus was that one of the Asst. Managers saw what happened, acknowledged the problems, and went out of her way to make it up to me. I had a package arrive after I had left, and she forwarded it immediately and comped me for breakfast. This is why I gave it two stars instead of one. If they had a general manager like her, they might attract business people.</p>

                <p class="text">I give this Hyatt a below average rating because for the price and class, this hotel should be providing more amenities. - No WiFi in the rooms, only in the lobby/atrium area (as if I enjoy doing business work in the lobby). - The business center only has one PC with no printers hooked up (print queue had 38 prints waiting and the manager simply said the PC is more for airline crews to quickly check on their flights, if they had a different business center she didn&amp;#39;t offer it up). - My room was well decorated and very comfortable, befitting of a Hyatt, but no coffee maker, no fridge, no microwave (I did have a kitchen style sink, it was a suite after all). The LCD TV was nice, though I hate the slow remote and no channel guide/info, as if I&amp;#39;m supposed to know what&amp;#39;s playing in Buffalo. - It is in downtown with a short walk to the convention center, and I highly recommend the Anchor Bar, Gordon&amp;#39;s Pub, and the Pearl St Brewery for local fair. - Oh yes, friendly staff, as always!</p>

                <p class="text">I come here from time to time, the Spot Coffee on Chippewa. It&amp;#39;s an excellent place to get a bite to eat/drink after a show downtown. Or it&amp;#39;s good to bring a book/get some work done as the couches are comfy, and it&amp;#39;s not too loud. The staff is friendly, and I joked around with them a bit. But probably number one is their desserts. Every dessert I&amp;#39;ve tried has been scrumptious! And each bite well worth the calories. ;)</p>

                <p class="text">Sopt coffee&amp;#39;s atmosphere is lamer than Starbucks. The staff acts like they are on a cheap knock off of cocaine. They are so self involved, they completely ignore their customers. The coffee is average to below average but presented pretentiously. If you want a great place in Buffalo go to Chow Chocolate in Elmwood village or Orange cat coffee in Lewiston, NY. Don&amp;#39;t waste a valuable half hour of your life here let alone your money.</p>

The music they play is AWFUL. can still hear it with headphones on. Also, it can get really loud and annoying on a busy morning. But despite all that I still come here twice a week.</p>

                <p class="text">We were at the Adam Mark for Swing Niagara - a swing dance convention hosting 500 people. Walked all over downtown. What a dissappointment. Then, like a mirage, I saw a Starbucks - a signal that I had found the better area. In need of better food than Starbucks offers, we went into The Spot. It was a nice surpise. Like finding a rose in a hill of weeds. And the mural. Tim Gaska painted a fantasy of downtown Buffalo - dated 1996. That alone was worth the visit.</p>

                <p class="text">Beer was good, atmosphere was nice. Unfortunately those are the only good things I have to say about this place. I went during a bigger event they held, and stood at the downstairs bar for 30-45 minutes waiting for a drink. Three waves of people came and went and I basically had to shove my money in her face before she served me. Then she didn&amp;#39;t know the price of anything on the drink menu (which was overpriced). Every time you asked her something the answer was &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know.&amp;quot; They kicked my friend out without her coat or phone and made her stand in 20 degree weather while I looked for her everywhere. Finally someone who worked there offered to stand with her by the coat check until I found her. He was very polite and nice and we are both incredibly thankful for his help, but when he tried to bring her in a brunette bouncer was extremely rude and DIDN&amp;#39;T EVEN KNOW THE EMPLOYEES WHO WORKED THERE. So unprofessional. She was extremely rude to me while I was exiting the venue. I&amp;#39;m not sure if she was a temporary bouncer hired for the event but because of her we will probably never go back. Perhaps they have good food, but I am so disgusted with the service I received I don&amp;#39;t even want to try it.</p>

                <p class="text">All the food was warm, but not hot. As if it was pre-ade and just sitting around waiting to be served. Even the chicken wings! The spices and sauces were basically just there. Ex. The Jerk Chicken was a piece of chicken breast dipped in some sort of sauce. Same idea for the other food - uninspired and made for fast service. The Beers were really good. It has a nice atmosphere, but avoid going there on a football evening if you&amp;#39;re not a Fan... my mistake going there Thursday. Loud... I&amp;#39;ll only go there again for the Beer and eat somewhere else before!</p>
