							<p class="text">Huge huge pastrami sandwich. You wonder why it&amp;#39;s $15 and then you realize that they give you over (what seems like) a pound of meat and 5-6 pickles on the side. Everything was amazing! Pastrami meat was very tender, juicy and flavorful. There were two types of pickles - I preferred the garlic sour ones the best. Staff was prompt, had a good sense of (New York) humor as well. Yeah, I&amp;#39;m sure they get a lot of tourists, but it still would be a nice place to grab a good sandwich once in awhile.</p>

							<p class="text">You might find yourself overwhelmed when you walk in. It can get pretty crowded, and all the lines are pretty confusing. Someone at the entrance will hand you a ticket. Don&amp;#39;t lose it! Remember, there are multiple lines all along the counter, and they all serve the same thing, so just stand in the shortest line. You hand your ticket to whoever served you, and he&amp;#39;ll mark it and give it back. On your way out, you give the ticket to the cashier. However, if you want to pay with credit, take your ticket to the end of the counter at the back of the restaurant, and they&amp;#39;ll take your card. I definitely recommend the pastrami sandwich here. It&amp;#39;s a bit pricy ($16), but you get a TON of meat in your sandwich. If you&amp;#39;re not a big eater, you can easily split the sandwich (and the check) with someone else.</p>

							<p class="text">This place is amazing, the food is beyond incredible. The hot pastrami sandwich was so delicious, I would even say it was moderately priced at $15 a sandwich considering how tasty it was. The service was pretty good by New York&amp;#39;s standards. Our waiter was attentive and friendly. I&amp;#39;m not in New York often, but I know every time I&amp;#39;m in the area I will definitely stop at Katz. Strongly recommend this restaurant.</p>

							<p class="text">Katz&amp;#39;s carries the best in meats. You may go in for the hot dogs which are the best in NYC but you can&amp;#39;t leave without either or both the brisket or pastrami. I worked in their neighborhood for a few years once as a teen working on Delancy and I would either have lunch there and/or take something delicious home. I recommend if you are a meat eater;this is the best place.</p>

							<p class="text">Kat&amp;#39;z. The dream of reliving what the LES once was. Too bad the dream turned into a nightmare. First of all, for a restaurant to have hired security is quite ridiculous, especially a Jewish deli. The security were extremely rude and all they would do is yell at you though really they should have been taking care of crowd control because it was a total mess of people inside not sure where to go. The ordering system makes sense once you have been there once, but as a first-timer (even though I grew up in NY, I never went until now) it was confusing especially with the hordes of people inside. Huge fire hazard as well. The ticket system is not too efficient and it is not explained well as you enter the restaurant. As a party of three, we were given three tickets, though we thought we would only need one because we are paying all together. This got us into a lot of trouble at the end when security would NOT LET US LEAVE even though we had a receipt, because we were missing two of our tickets. This is when the situation got ugly. The security were extremely unprofessional to everybody in my party, using sarcasm and mocking tones. They told us that we can go ahead and call the police but it would be a waste because they would be against us. We basically became prisoners unable to leave the restaurant even though we had proof we paid. Ultimately we had to find the manager and explain what happened. He acted like he was doing us a huge favor to have us escorted out. The food was good, very good. The knishes were some of the best I&amp;#39;ve ever had. But, I can go to Ben&amp;#39;s and have a much more enjoyable experience without the crazy security and the food is on par with Kat&amp;#39;z (and cheaper).</p>

We all were panicking while the employes just laughed and said there was nothing to worry about. Guess what, when an escalator does not work it becomes STAIRS! Their emergency drill needs severe improvement I will never be back. 1/28/13 @ 3pm</p>

							<p class="text">AMNH is definitely one of my two favorite museums in NYC (if not in US). Must see for anyone visiting the city. The museum has an amazing collection of permanent exhibitions alone. Do not miss the dinosaur fossils, planetarium, and ocean life! It&amp;#39;s practically impossible to see and appreciate every exhibition in the museum in one sitting so try to see only a few at a time and save the rest for subsequent visits.</p>

							<p class="text">The American Museum of Natural History (abbreviated as AMNH), located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City is one of the largest and most celebrated museums in the world. Located in park-like grounds across the street from Central Park, the Museum comprises 25 interconnected buildings that house 46 permanent exhibition halls, research laboratories, and its renowned library. The collections contain over 32 million specimens, of which only a small fraction can be displayed at any given time. The Museum has a scientific staff of more than 200, sponsors over 100 special field expeditions each year,[5] and averages about five million visits annually.</p>

							<p class="text">The AMNH is such an exciting, awe-inspiring, dynamic museum, so it&amp;#39;s no wonder why it gets such high reviews! From the Hayden Planetarium, to the dinosaurs to the special exhibits, there&amp;#39;s a lot to see so it&amp;#39;s best to pace yourself. If you want to avoid the big family crowds, it&amp;#39;s best to go during the week or on a rainy day. The food offerings at the cafes are decent, but can be a bit pricey. If you have the time/flexibility, opt for lunch or dinner at one of the many restaurants on the UWS.</p>

							<p class="text">It&amp;#39;s a beautiful building, inside and out, with really lovely views over Central Park. Be prepared to fight kids and tourists for a spot by the best exhibits. Handily for those with smartphones, there&amp;#39;s an app with maps and a self-guided highlights tour so you don&amp;#39;t miss out (or get lost).</p>

							<p class="text">I have never been so disappointed in a venue before like I was at Blue Note tonight. My wonderful boyfriend got us tickets to see Kenny G. He is so generous and bought the much more expensive table tickets. We arrived with proof of ticket purchase but had to be given an additional ticket to prove we paid and that we had to show our waitress. We were shown to our table. We could not even manage to squeeze through to sit down. No one would get up to allow us to sit. The staff was of no help. We had to force and squeeze our way in. Barely able to move we eased into our seats (the more expensive entrance!). I ended up with my back to the stage the entire night because there was literally not an inch to move to be able to turn and face the stage. The waitress asked if we wanted anything. We did not order as we could not imagine how we were going to maneuver any kind of eating or drinking in such tight quarters. We then received a bill for the full show because we did not produce the ticket given at the door after we entered. We could not move to get it out of our coat pockets. Kenny G played for just about an hour. Not very long for $85 tickets. The icing on the cake was getting hit with a bill for the tickets and &amp;quot;sitting at the table&amp;quot;. Once they verified that we did indeed pay for our tickets we were still required to pay our &amp;quot;table fee&amp;quot;&amp;#39;! Wasn&amp;#39;t that why we paid extra for the tickets? We would have been much more comfortable if we stood the one hour at the bar. In fact we would have been better off if we stayed home and listened to his CD! I know Blue Note is a NYC icon. I see it as a rip off fire trap!</p>

You get to tour all the most important parts of these old aircraft carriers. There was lots of interactive exhibits and movies. The history of this place is astounding and it&amp;#39;s humbling to be aboard a ship where so many have sacrificed their lives in battle. The staff here were all really awesome. They love telling you anything you want to know and their posted all over to answer questions. Definitely reserve tickets online and show up early to beat the lines. They don&amp;#39;t have a very good system for getting you through the ticket booth. Don&amp;#39;t forget the submarine- it&amp;#39;s one of the best parts!</p>

							<p class="text">DO NOT BUY TICKETS TO THE SPACE SHUTTLE EXHIBIT!! The &amp;quot;Exhibit&amp;quot; is pure garbage! No information, no displays, nothing to see! All you do is wait an hour on line, to go inside, to wait 30 minutes on line, to get on line, to walk by the shuttle! &amp;quot;NO PHOTOS PLEASE!! KEEP THE LINE MOVING!&amp;quot; Photos of WHAT?! All we see is the bottom of the shuttle -- which doesn&amp;#39;t have its engines, or its tiles, etc.! No history of the shuttle, or the astronauts, or the disasters, or the accomplishments, or the missions, or anything! This museum has totally failed NASA, and doesn&amp;#39;t deserve the shuttle. Unless NYC can find someone else to take it, NASA should take it back! And the rest of the museum is quite disappointing as well. Not nearly as informative as ANY other, for example. And lines, lines, lines! Very expensive, not very interactive, not informative at all, and nothing to give tribute to those who served aboard the ship. Just a memorial to those who died -- which is nice. And, if they have an event the night that you go, they kick you out of the museum 45 minutes early without prior notice. So expect to waste your money that way, too. Mind you, we never got to see the submarine -- having spent the entire day on lines. Maybe they hide the entire exhibit in there -- but I doubt it very much. The whole museum is terribly run, and very disappointing. Walk next to it and snap some photos -- it&amp;#39;s just not worth it.</p>

Tip: Buy tickets on line and get there when it opens or be prepared to stand in line 2 to 3 hours to get in. Pack a lunch. Food is over priced and not very good. Otherwise, it was very interesting. Probably should have popped the extra $22 per person for the guided tour.</p>

							<p class="text">I love museums and I love learning things. Another perk on living in NYC is all the great Museums. This is definitely one of them. The Guggenheim was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. It&amp;#39;s a one of a kind building in NYC and it really stands out. From the outside it looks like a building from the future. It was really ahead of it&amp;#39;s time. Once inside you would think that that it would be normal, but just as rounded as the outside is. The inside is as well. You walk into an open space and the entrance is to your left. You have the choice to use the elevator or walk up the winding staircase or ramps. So far I have been here twice. The first time was for the Maurizio Catellan Exhibit. Just the other day I saw the John Chamberlain Exhibit. Unlike Catellan, where his work was all hanging from the ceiling. Chamberlains work can be seen all along the sides of the Guggenheim. I do love how open the Guggenheim is. You have a great view of the works and you know where they are just by looking across. The museum isn&amp;#39;t big, but does have some great works of art. F-R-E-E (well not really) on Saturdays between the hours of 5:45-7:45pm. It is pay as you wish. As it says, you can pay whatever you want to see the exhibits. Since it&amp;#39;s pay as you wish or practically FREE. Be prepared to wait in line or do come early. Real early!</p>

							<p class="text">Skip the Guggenheim! My fiancee and I went there only to discover that half the museum was closed for putting in a new exhibit. The remainder of the museum had some good impressionist paintings but the rest of the floors were of some photographer whose art was not to our liking. Bathrooms and the floor plan are horrible. We had a city pass that gave us the choice between the top of the Rock and this. We tried to get a refund but couldn&amp;#39;t. The Metropolitan museum was fantastic! Spend your time there.</p>

							<p class="text">I really like this museum when they have good exhibitions. Be sure to attend an exhibition opening with the receiption. The exhibit goes up in a spiral so the smart thing to do is to climb all the way to the top and slowly walk downwhile seeing every exhibit. One of the centerpieces I loved is a large car hanging from the ceiling with arrows in it - so cool.</p>
